# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Thoughts**: Both before and after being laid off last summer, I spent quite a bit of time on sites like [HackerRank](http://www.hackerrank.com) and [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) ramping up on new technology and knocking the rust off of coding skills after 2 1/2 years of pure management.  In my new role I need to ramp up Angular and Node.js, and I intend to use 100 Days of Code to help keep me consistent.

**Today's Progress**: Completed parts 15, 16, and 17 of The Complete Node.js Developer Course on Udemy.  My Notes app saves notes to a file, reads them back from a file, and prevents notes from having duplicated titles.  I also updated the getAll function to call fetchNotes.  Once I get further along in the course we'll see if my implementation matches the instructor's or note.

**Tomorrow's Plan**:  Spend at least an hour implementing solutions to HackerRank's 30 Days of Code, beginning with Day 20 (the previous 19 days were done sporadically last year)

### Day 2: January 3, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 20 (sorting with bubble sort) and Day 21 (generics) with C# solutions.  Day 20 took awhile, since I probably haven't written a bubble sort since undergrad.  Also added "remove note" capability to my Notes app.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Added "read note" capability to my Notes app.  I also figured out how to upgrade the version of node I've been running and got rid of my Anaconda install (brew doctor complained about its config scripts and I haven't really used Anaconda, so no need to keep it).

### Day 4: January 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately I didn't make a full hour of progress today.  I made a tiny bit of progress with the app you build as part of the [Angular Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents) course (from Pluralsight) when I wasn't conducting testing of some development work I did for my day job.  I also refrain from work and work-related activities during Sabbath hours, so it will be tomorrow evening before I get back to it.
